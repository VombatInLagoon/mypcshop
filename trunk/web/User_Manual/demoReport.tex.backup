This Text is a step-by-step guide for the users of the pcshop online application.
 

\section*{Installation}

\subsection*{Deployment}

To deploy the application you need to have appache tomcat installed on your system.
Put the pcShop2011.war file into the webapps directory of your tomcat installation forlder.
By Starting the tomcat the project will be automatically deployed into the tomcat container.
The next step is to change the tomcat server.xml descriptor file to force it to use the JDBC Realm instead of defualt relam.
To do so you need to copy the lines from the file context.xml under the folder web/META-INF to the server.xml file of the tomcat config folder.
Or you can use the file server.xml in the folder web/META-INF and replace the tomcat sercer.xml file with this one!
The next step is to setup the database needed for the application.



\subsection*{DataBase Installation}

You must have mysql server installed on your system with the user name {\bf root} and password {\bf sesame}.
To setup the database required by the application you should run the script {\it setup.sh} which resides under the folder web/dbSql 
and when prompted for password you enter {\bf sesame} as password.
If you dont have the Connector/J Api on your java path you should copy the file {\it mysql-connector-java-5.1.16-bin.jar} from folder
web/WEB-INF/lib to your tomcat library folder.
Now you are ready to use the application.


\section*{Start}

To start the application first you need to run your tomcat container.
Then open your browser and type in the address bar the following address:

{\it http://localhost:tomcat port/pcShop2011}}



\section*{Main Menu}

Under the left panel you can find main sections of the application which are as followe:

\begin{itemize}

\item Home

\item List of Products

\item Edit Your Profile

\item Contact Customer Service

\item Admin Application

\end{itemize}




\section*{Home}

This is the homr page of the application which shows the user a welcome page. 



\section*{List of Products}

In this sub section you can choose the product that you will buy. Pc or Laptop computer.
Currently this is only valid to shop a pc from this site!


\subsection*{Product List}

By clicking on the Pc icon you reach to this page which shows you a list of products that are offered currently  
by the shop. The amount column shows the quantity of each product currently available by the shop.You can buy an availbale
number of one or more than one products. Clicking the select button will add the quantity of each product into the 
shopping cart.Then to go on with shopping process you need to use the {\bf Checkout } link of the shopping cart.
Then you will forward to the log-in page that will ask you for your user name and password. If you are a new user
you should register yourself in the shop by following the {\it registerhere} link. Otherwise Enter your user name 
and password to lig in to the site to continue shopping process.
After logging in to the site your profile will be shown beside your shopping cart. you can edit your profile data.
And then click on the Buy button.Then you will be directed to the {\it Thank You} page.Then by Clicking
on the {\it by more product} you will be directed to the Product list page to buy more project.
The shopped quantities has been removed from the product list.
In this page there is also a link with name {\it Detail} which will show you the list of components of each product.
 

\section*{Edit Your Profile}
Using this part you can edit your profile information (in case you are a registered user in the system!).
You will be asked to enter your user name and password then you will reach to the update profile page.
Here you see your current profile information which you can change. You can also change your roles in the system.
If you are a user with admin role all of roles will be shown to you.Other wise just the tomcat and manager role will 
be shown to you. (Security purpose!)
Click on Go to save your changes.

\section*{Contact Customer Service}

In this section you can contact the site customer service and give your feed back or ask your questions and so on.
You must enter the necessary fields which are marked with astrics.
And then click on submit button.



\section*{Administrator Area}

This part is the Admin section of the application, which is designed to support the administrative tasks on the
web site such as adding new product and ordering new components.
to enter this area you need to be a member of admin users and have a valid user name and password.




\subsection*{Welcome to Admin Pae}

In this page you have two optins available.

\begin{itemize}

\item Go to the Components Page

\item Add new products!

\end{itemize}




\subsection*{Go to the Components Page}

Choosing this option will show you the list of all components available in the shop.
(This set is predefined which means that you cannot add new component in the shop)
Then you can order amount of component in this section.The effect will be added in the database.


\subsection*{Add New Product Page}
In this part you will see a list of current product available in the shop. And you can also add a new product by
clicking on the {\it Add New Product} button.




\subsection*{Please Enter The New Product}




\subsection*{Question 14}
\textit{What swarm size gave you the best results? For the remaining
parameters, did settings similar to those that performed best in 2-D also work
well in 20-D, or did you have to change them?}

A swarm size of 26 gave the best results. For the remaining parameter, the same
parameters as that of 2-D worked well for 20-D. However, $OnOff\_RegPSO = on$ improved
the $fg = 6.2588$ to $fg = 0.8686$.

\subsection*{Question 15}
\textit{How does the best minimum you located compare with the results
from the same function using GA? How does it feel like the speed of the two
algorithms compares (you don't need to give a specific time value, just a general
impression)?}

The minimum location with PSO is better than that found by GA. However, when it comes
to speed(execution time) GA is faster than PSO.

\section*{Task 5: Training a Neural Network}

\subsection*{Question 16}
\textit{Did you find a set of parameters that consistently avoided the
high error solutions we sometimes found in lab 1?}

The following parameters seems to be helpful avoiding the high error solutions


\texttt{net.trainParam}

\texttt{ans = }
          \\\texttt{     show: 1000}
             \\\texttt{epochs: 4000}
               \\\texttt{time: Inf}
               \\\texttt{goal: 1.0000e-03}
           \\\texttt{max\_fail: 20}
       \\\texttt{max\_perf\_inc: 1.0400e+00}
    \\\texttt{showCommandLine: 1}
         \\\texttt{showWindow: 0}
            \\\texttt{plotPSO: 1}


\section*{Task 6: Wrapping up}

\subsection*{Question 17}
\textit{GA and PSO are both population methods, and they can be used
to solve the same type of problems. What characterizes a problem that would
be easier to solve using GA? What about a problem that is easier to solve with
PSO?}

The PSO algorithm is normally useful when dealing with problems which are consists
of particles that are too much alike. Their acts and behaviors as a whole is the 
matter of importance, but not each of their individual separately. The system does 
not evolve in its inner characteristics during the time, but in case of GA, the 
system must have some mutations during solving the problem to achieve better results.
Example of such system would be some smart virii which mutate their DNA and RNA to 
overcome the body's immune system.


\subsection*{Question 18}
\textit{Propose a real-world problem that you consider interesting and
that you believe can be solved using what you just learned. Explain in a few
sentences how that would work.}

There are many interesting real world problems which could be solved using swarm 
intelligence technique. For example in film production, to simulate the movement of 
a large number of similar entities (birds, fishes, cattle) the swarm intelligence 
can be used ( and it is used indeed).

It has been used in many well known films such as ``Lord of the Rings" during battle 
scenes and ``Batman Returns" for showing the movements of a group of bats.

It has also been used in the industry to simulate autonomous robots that are ``dumb"
when considered individually, but rather smart as a group. They can be used in applications
such as exploring the ocean floor, rescue earthquake victims from under debris etc.

\subsection*{Question 19}
\textit{What would you have liked to see in today's lab? Were there
tasks that you feel need improvement?}

The lab was comprehensive in its treatment of Evolutionary computation and Swarm intelligence.
Improvement can perhaps be made with respect to Swarm intelligence by including ant colony
optimization and its applications such as solving TSP.
